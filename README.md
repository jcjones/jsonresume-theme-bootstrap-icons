#jsonresume-theme-classy-patents

A fork of the [uber-classy](https://github.com/JaredCubilla/jsonresume-theme-classy) theme for JSONResume, to rework it into Bootstrap and add some personal flair, particularly around patent-type publications.

## Usage

To first get started with this JSONResume theme, you'll need to have the JSONResume CLI installed. If you haven't already install it with `npm install -g resume-cli`. If this doesn't work, try `sudo npm install -g resume-cli`.

After this, you can get your resume.json ready by typing `resume init`. After hitting enter, your resume will be initialized and you can edit it and fill in the neccessary fields. Check out [the official resume-schema repository](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema) for more information on filling these fields.

When you are finished with your resume, you may test it by yet again opening the command line and typing `resume serve --theme classy-patents` to see how it looks with this theme. You can replace the word `classy` with other theme names too.

If you want a local copy of your resume, type in `resume export resumeName --theme classy-patents`, and replace `resumeName` with the desired filename. You can export it in pdf and txt using the `--format` flag, like so:

```
resume export resume --format pdf --theme classy-patents
```

However, if you wish to export it to the JSONResume Registry, use the command `resume publish` instead.

More details about the CLI and it's commands are available [here](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli).

## Tips

The publications section understands patents a little better now.
```json
 "publications": [
    {
      "name": "Secure communication system for mobile devices",
      "patentNumber": "US 8,392,699",
      "summary": "A system for improving PKI performance and reliability by re-imagining the standard protocols into a disadvantaged and unreliable network architecture. This is a core technology of SAIFEÂ®.",
      "status": "Issued",
      "releaseDate": "2013-03-05",
      "website": "http://www.google.com/patents/US8392699"
    }
 ]
```

As of now, the "Classy" theme supports the following profiles in the bio.profiles array:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Google Plus
* Linkedin
* YouTube
* Behance
* CodePen
* Vimeo
* Flickr
* Github
* Pinterest

Every single one of these is optional, and every field in the bio.profiles array **must** be entered lowercase, without spaces. If you want support for more social networks, feel free to leave an issue. Thanks.

If you want to keep your resume mobile-friendly, please limit the number of profiles to 10, please. No one should have over 10 profiles on their resume anyway.

Every section is optional also. If per se, you do not include the publications array in your resume.json, no publications section will appear.

If you find any other problems with this theme in specified, do feel free to leave an issue. Thanks.
